## Activity 1: Divide and Conquer & Greedy Algorithms

In this activity, we dive into two fundamental algorithmic strategies: Divide and Conquer and Greedy Algorithms. Divide and Conquer involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving each independently, and then combining the solutions to tackle the original problem. Greedy Algorithms, on the other hand, make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Through this activity, we explore the theory behind these strategies and apply them to various problem-solving scenarios.
